                    In addition to my full-time job, I took on freelance projects, including collaborating with a small startup team to build a transportation platform for cargo clients. We agreed to create an MVP to showcase to potential investors.
<br><br>
At the time, Angular had just released its 4th version, making it an ideal choice for this project. We also opted for Yandex Maps API, as it offered the best functionality for our goals.
<br><br>
This project presented a great opportunity for me to explore the new features of Angular and refresh my knowledge in working with maps API. However, despite our best efforts, the project was unsuccessful and was closed within six months.

                        The initial version of this application was developed utilizing the AlphaPoint library, which was further customized to fulfill the specific requirements of our team.
                        However, with the increasing complexity of our project, we realized that relying solely on the third-party solution might not be the most efficient approach for us.
                        <br><br>
                        Hence, we made the decision to develop our own solution, allowing for greater flexibility and customization capabilities.
                        The migration process was executed with great attention to detail to ensure minimal disruption to the existing functionality and to maintain the integrity of our data.
                        <br><br>
                        Overall, the transition to our own solution has proven to be a worthwhile investment, enabling us to have more control over the development process and ensuring a higher level of performance for our application.

                    This was a sophisticated and reliable e-commerce marketplace built with Django (Python). It provides a platform for users to create customized products with unique designs and text, and place orders. Additionally, it allows users to create an online shop by featuring products created on the platform.
<br><br>
One of the primary challenges we faced was the unintuitive user experience, which was difficult to modify using existing technologies. Consequently, we opted to rebuild the platform using Vue.js and transform it into a Single Page Application.
<br><br>
As part of the project, I implemented several features to boost conversion rates, such as a "featured items" section. We also improved the design and enhanced flexibility and responsiveness, leading to a noticeable increase in loading speed.

                    During my four-month tenure in a startup team, I was primarily responsible for the merchant dashboard. The dashboard's frontend was built with React, and we used Redux for state management. Once I joined the team, we initiated several improvements to the dashboard, including:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Enhanced the dashboard design and added new pages.</li>
<li>Reorganized our reusable UI components approach and utilized styleguidist while also finishing the UI kit.</li>
<li>Modified the flow of displaying all states asynchronously, such as Request sent, Request success, Request error. We shifted to optimistic updates while reverting to the previous value on error.</li>
<li>Optimized the forms, added client-side validation with Formik.</li>
</ul>
Working with such a motivated startup team and engaging in such an ambitious project was an excellent opportunity for me to explore new things. I am grateful for the experience and look forward to collaborating with them again in the future.

                    I was presented with a challenging project, as the previous developer was unable to add the features needed. It is always more difficult to maintain someone else's code than to create something from scratch, particularly when it was developed on a framework I had not used before. However, I viewed this as an opportunity to expand my skills and knowledge, specifically with Backbone.
                    <br><br>
                    To tackle this challenge, I leveraged JavaScript-Canvas-To-Blob and file-saver.js libraries. Although unfamiliar with these tools initially, I quickly grasped their functionalities and implemented a duct tape solution to ensure the successful completion of the project.
                    <br><br>
                    My work on this project didn't stop there; I continued to receive requests to maintain it until it was eventually closed, having achieved its objectives. I relished the opportunity to further develop my skills and build my experience working with complex codebases.

                    Ikea Mood Forecast was a promotional web application that I had the privilege to work on while employed at Smarthead. The application was designed to allow users to customize their room interiors depending on the weather outside. The user could select any city in the world, and the window view and furniture in the photo would change accordingly.
                    <br><br>
                    The project involved the development of a complex and visually stunning solution, which included animations that changed depending on the weather forecast. For instance, on rainy days, the user would see rain animation, while on cloudy days, there would be clouds. Some interiors even included a mirror with window reflection, creating a truly immersive experience.
                    <br><br>
                    To enhance the user experience, we developed special music for the app, consisting of five streams that corresponded to the state of temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitations, and atmospheric pressure. We utilized Web Audio API to synchronize these streams, as the default HTML5 audio could not keep up. For backward compatibility with old browsers, we also added HTML5 audio.
                    <br><br>
                    Although I cannot disclose the details of the other complex and beautiful solutions that we developed for famous brands, working on Ikea Mood Forecast was a memorable experience that allowed me to hone my skills in web development and user experience design.
