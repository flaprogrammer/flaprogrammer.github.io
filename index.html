                    </p>
                    <p>Besides my fulltime job I also had time for freelance jobs. Here I helped one small
                    startup team to build platform where clients can find carriers to transport the cargo.
                    We decided to created MVP to show it to investors.</p>
                    <p>It was time when Angular just released 4th version (by skipping 3rd), so why not use
                    it for this? For maps we took Yandex Maps API, because for our goals it was the best
                    variant.</p>
                    <p>It was a good opportunity to see what changes appeared in new Angular and refresh my
                    memories in working with maps API.</p>

                    <p>Unfortunately, project wasnâ€™t successful, and they closed in half a year.</p>

                        <strong>Stack:</strong> Angular.js, Symfony 2, Karma, Jasmine
                    </p>
                    <p>I worked for Upwork Global Inc in Job Search UI team for 2 years. We were responsible for Job Search
                    page (<a href="https://www.upwork.com/o/jobs/browse/">https://www.upwork.com/o/jobs/browse/</a>),
                    Find Work Feed(<a href="https://www.upwork.com/ab/find-work">https://www.upwork.com/ab/find-work/</a>).
                    For about half a year I helped other team with moving to new responsive version of Job Post
                    (<a href="https://www.upwork.com/ab/job-post/new">https://www.upwork.com/ab/job-post/new</a>).</p>

                    <p>It was the biggest web application I've ever worked on, and the most professional team and
                    development process organization. All our team members worked remotely from the different
                    parts of Earth: Europe, Asia, North and South America. Also I had a chance to see how big
                    companies with a lot of developers (~300) work. I'm thankful for the unique experience of
                    being part of the company who really helps to reduce inequality in the world.</p>

                    <p>What about technologies, I used Symfony 2 (PHP framework), Composer, Angular.js, HTML/CSS.
                    We didn't use any 3rd party libraries and created a lot of things from scratch.
                    Our team used Scrum approach. So yes, we had sprints, meetings (sprint plannings, backlog
                    groomings, demos, retrospectives). And it was done great.</p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Stack:</strong> Vue.js, Vuex, SCSS
                    </p>
                    <p>This was a stable working marketplace made on Django (Python). Users can customize
                    different products by custom designs, texts and then order them. Also you can create
                    online shop, based on this website with products you created here.</p>

                    <p>The problem was that UX sometimes was not so intuitive and it was too hard to change
                    it using current technologies, so we decided to rebuild it into Single Page Application,
                    by Vue.js.</p>

                    <p>I have added featured items, trying to increase conversion. Also we added opportunity to
                    change selected properties (product, design, text) on any step. Design got more flexible
                    and responsive, loading speed noticeably increased.</p>

                        <strong>Stack:</strong> React.js, Redux, Formik, SCSS
                    </p>
                    I had a chance to get in the team for 4 months and mostly worked on merchants dashboard.
                    Frontend was built using React and Redux for state management.

                    <p>
                        After my joining we did a lot of changes, let me list some of them
                        <ul>

                            <li>
                                Made a lot of updates in design of dashboard, added new pages
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Redrafted our reusable UI components approach, started using styleguidist and almost finished UI kit
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Started displaying all states in asynchronous flow. (Request sent, request success, request error).
                                Moved to optimistic updates with returning to old value on error.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Improved forms, added client-side validation by Formik
                            </li>

                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    It was a great opportunity to join so ambitious team and dive into the atmosphere of startup. I really appreciate everything they did to me and hope to work with them in the future.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Stack:</strong> Backbone.js, CSS, file-saver.js
                    </p>
                    <p>Project started with words "Our current developer couldn't add features we need,
                    so we're not sure it's possible". What a challenge? Let's go.</p>

                    <p>Maintaining another's code always harder than writing something from scratch,
                    especially if it was done on framework you had never used before. But good chance
                    to learn Backbone.</p>
                    <p>Also there were JavaScript-Canvas-To-Blob and file-saver.js libraries, but it didn't
                    take much time to understand how they work. Some code refactoring, one duct tape
                    solution and feature is ready!</p>

                    <p>After that I had few requests to maintain this project, until it wasn't successfully
                    closed. But I liked it.</p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Stack:</strong> jQuery, Web Audio API, CSS
                    </p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, it was the only project without NDA when I worked in Smarthead. We created
                    a lot of complex and beautiful solutions for famous brands, but I can't mention them.</p>

                    <p>Ikea Mood Forecast was a promo web application where room interior changes depending on
                    the weather outside. By default it shows your city, but you can select any city in the
                    world. And you can but everything in the photo on IKEA website.</p>

                    <p>Depending on the forecast window view also changes. On cloudy days you can see some clouds,
                    on wet weather snow or rain animation. (In some interiors there was also a mirror with
                    window reflection).</p>

                    <p>Also we had special music for this. It consisted of 5 streams, where every one of them
                    showed state of temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitations and atmosphere pressure.
                    Default HTML5 audio couldn't keep the rhythm and sync 5 streams, so we used Web Audio API
                    (but for old browsers like IE9 we still added HTML5 audio for backward compatibility).</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>In Fantasy Technologies this was the biggest project I've worked on. The idea was to
                    "full-scratch" existing application, with moving backend to Node.js and refactoring
                    client side, which was made on Adobe AIR.</p>

                    <p>The application was used in a chain of fitness clubs. Admins and managers can add new
                    users in the system, see all logs and statistics. Ð¡lients can control their subscription
                    and training process by personal RFID cards.</p>

                    <p>And if I'm not mistaken, they still use this soft.</p>

                                We worked together with Lenar for 2 years. I'm very pleased with his work. He's hard-working,
                                neat, and he likes to face new challenges. He is always on the move, and learns new things
                                all the time. Lenar often helped other developers in our company.

                                P.S. Our whole team cried a lot after he left our company. We listened to Titanic OST and
                                ate a lot of cake. Now, when pain left, there are only void in our souls. Maybe we should
                                try to fill it with some nice dog, or buy PS4... It can help.
